I need to create a landing page for a platform called A2S – Aesthetics to Spaces. The landing page should be ultra-detailed, professional, minimal, readable, and appealing to both budget-conscious users and luxury customers. It must contain all the following content and features component-wise. Avoid flashy colors or overly AI-generated aesthetics. Use neutral, soft, and clean tones, readable fonts, subtle shadows, and minimal hover effects. The page should be modern but professional, targeting both B2C and B2B users. Components should have labels where indicated.
